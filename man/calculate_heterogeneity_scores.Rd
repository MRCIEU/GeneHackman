\title{Test for heterogeneity of effect estimates between populations}
\usage{
calculate_heterogeneity_scores(gwases_by_ancestry, heterogeneity_score_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{gwases_by_ancestry}{Named list of data frames, one for each population, with at least bhat, se and snp columns}
}
\value{
List
\itemize{
\item Q = vector of p-values for Cochrane's Q statistic for each SNP
\item Qj = Data frame of per-population outlier q values for each SNP
}
}
\description{
For each SNP this function will provide a Cochran's Q test statistic -
a measure of heterogeneity of effect sizes between populations. A low p-value means high heterogeneity.
In addition, for every SNP it gives a per population p-value -
this can be interpreted as asking for each SNP is a particular giving an outlier estimate.
